						The logo is a visual simplification of the unique spirit and history of Negros Occidental. It is also an invitation to travelers who want know more about the province. It features the image of a jumping-even dancing-figure, with its colorful scarf blowing in the wind. This symbolizes the celebratory & creative nature of the people. The elements that make up this jumping/dancing figure are derived from two of the province's main properties: sugar & mountains. The raised arms of the jumping figure are a graphic rendition of two sugarcanes, while its jumping legs', of Mount Kanlaon.
						The sugarcanes are placed above the mountain, so as to acknowledge the source of its strength - Mount Kanlaon's volcanic activities of old being a source of its fertile soil. They also double as a sign of many blessings from the mountain gods - represented by Mount Kanlaon, to both the province's inhabitants and to its visitors.
						The head of the figure, is the sun, which symbolizes life, while the scarf is a gust of wind, symbolizing spontaneity. Both these elements signify NATURE as well.
						The logo's color, magenta, signifies the creative spirit of the people.
